Various scripts that, while useful, don't deserve a project of their own.

blcheck.sh:
    A script, started from a forum post
    (http://www.daemonforums.org/showthread.php?t=302), to check an IP on
    a number of blacklists.  It's not the most clever bit of code, but it
    works.  I modified it to make the output more appropriate for cron: it
    doesn't have any when things are ok.  It also has an exit code that
    indicates how many blacklists you got a hit on.

    I'm running it from cron as:
    blcheck.sh $( ifconfig eth0 | grep 'inet addr' | awk '{print $2}' | awk -F: '{print $2}' )
    which isn't the best commandline either, but it's not bad.  If I had
    puppet on here I'd probably use facter to get the IP.
